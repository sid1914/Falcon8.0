Javascript :- 

- javascript is used for building logics of a web page.
- javascript is a high lebel programming language, used in both client side as well as server side. 
- javascript is comes from echma script so we see the latest version of javascript in the form of echma script. 
- Now we used javascript version 6 i.e ES6 (echma-script 6).
- In another way we called ES6 as the vanilla javascript. 
- Node js is the run time environment of javascript. 

variable :- 

- variable is a container to store some data. 
- In javascript there are 3 types of variable are there.. 

1. let :- 

- let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later. 
- Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable. 
- let is a block scope code so we have been used let for most of the cases. 

2. var :- 

- var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable in later stage. 
- var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are don't use var most of the cases. 

3. const :- const means constant. 

task - difference between Let & Var 

Rules for creating variable name :- 

- Variable names are case sensative "a", & "A" is different.
- Only letter, digit, underscore & special character is allowed, (not even white space).
- Only letter, underscore or special character should be the 1st character only. 
- reserved words cannot be a variable name. 

Datatypes in JS :- 

- datatypes is anh attributes associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interprit its valyue. 
- in datatype we used "typeof" operator to know that what type of data it is. 
- mainlly in javascript there are 2 types of datatype we used. 

1. Primitive Datatype

- in javascript there are 7 types of primitive datatypes we used :- 
1. Number - Number are the type of datatype those it contains some numerical values
2. Boolean - in Boolean datatypes we get boolean value like true/false.
3. Undefined - data is not define.
4. Null - in this datatype we get null for the value means nothing. 
5. bigInt - in bigInt we will get the big integer value (-999999999 to +999999999) on the above.
6. String - String is a type of datatypes that can hold some character like names or word etc..
7. Symbol - in Symbol we get one symbol of more than one value.

2. Reference Datatype

- Reference datatype are the type of datatype which can hold multiple element in a single time. 
- Reference datatypes are -> array, object, Function

1. Array :- 

- array is a datatype where we can store similar type of data is a contigious memory location. 
- array indexing starts from "0".

ex - let arr = ["ram", "hari", "sita", "bharat"]
                  0      1       2        3

2. Object :- 

- object is reference type datatype where we can store more than one element in a single entity. 
- mainly objects are working on (key:value) pair. 

ex. - 

let emp1 = {
    "name" : "sonu kumar",
    "age" : "76",
    "address" : "bhubaneswar",
    "mobile no." : 546789032,
    "salary" : 56789332
}

- in the above example we can see that the left hand side elements are the keys & the right hand side element are values so we can tell that object is a key:value pair structure.
